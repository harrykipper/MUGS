# MUGS - Model of Urban Green Spaces. 

An agent-based model of the emergence of inter-city differences in the usage of green spaces.
The model is spatially explicit and data driven. It simulates Scottish cities in their 16+ population, urban form and distribution of green spaces and socio economic condition. The model is meant to explore to what extent a city's urban form and social mix may determine the emergence of a shared, cross-class culture of  using green spaces.

# Drivers of the dynamics
## Pull factors
### Culture

* Initial probability of visiting green space uniformly distribuited with means differing by social class.

### Social influence

Observation of otherâ€™s behaviour. Diffrent possible implementations:

* _normative behaviors are influenced by relative shifts in observed behaviours_
  * observe differences in the number of park-goers in local area from day to day (or week to week). Increase will encourage people to go, decrease will do nothing (or discourage).
* compare local behaviour against global (city)
* confront own area with rest of city, more park goers encourage people to go, less do nothing. (computationally less demanding, but less realistic)
* Observe global city wide behaviour.

### Walkability

A walkability measure is introduced. Agents in highly walkable areas will be more likely to visit green spaces, likewise those in less walkable place will tend to visit less.


## Push factors
### Dissonance (experience)

* class mix - as an homage to the homophily passion
* age mix - following Seaman et al.
* ethnic mix - not implemented (yet)

We assume that the extreme age groups (young and old) will be more sensitive to age differences, the others will be more sensitive to class differences.

Both evaluated against a tolerance parameter, uniformly distributed in the population.

* Should tolerance differ by age/class?

If too many (randomly selected) people in the park the same day are too different, dissonance increases, the person is discouraged to go again.

## Geography

* Areas of reference are postcode areas
* Population - an accurate reproduction in scale of Scottish cities (1/20 or 1/40).
  * Age, gender, SEC (no ethnicity yet. Gender possibly irrelevant)
  * Under 16/ Over 64 missing - will include.
* Agents randomly choose one among list of nearby parks.
  * Bigger parks have a larger catchment area
